# Use groupby and summary statistical methods to calculate the following properties of each drug regimen: 
# mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume. 


# Assemble the resulting series into a single summary DataFrame.









# Generate a bar plot showing the total number of rows (Mouse ID/Timepoints) for each drug regimen using Pandas.



# Generate a bar plot showing the total number of rows (Mouse ID/Timepoints) for each drug regimen using pyplot.



# Generate a pie plot showing the distribution of female versus male mice using Pandas



# Generate a pie plot showing the distribution of female versus male mice using pyplot






# Calculate the final tumor volume of each mouse across four of the treatment regimens:  
# Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin

# Start by getting the last (greatest) timepoint for each mouse


# Merge this group df with the original DataFrame to get the tumor volume at the last timepoint



# Put treatments into a list for for loop (and later for plot labels)


# Create empty list to fill with tumor vol data (for plotting)


# Calculate the IQR and quantitatively determine if there are any potential outliers. 

    
    # Locate the rows which contain mice on each drug and get the tumor volumes

    
    # add subset 

    
    # Determine outliers using upper and lower bounds



# Generate a box plot that shows the distrubution of the tumor volume for each treatment group.






# Generate a line plot of tumor volume vs. time point for a single mouse treated with Capomulin



# Generate a scatter plot of mouse weight vs. the average observed tumor volume for the entire Capomulin regimen






# Calculate the correlation coefficient and a linear regression model 
# for mouse weight and average observed tumor volume for the entire Capomulin regimen
